<p><strong>CogView-4</strong> is the image generation model inside GLM-Image, made by Zhipu AI. It is the first large AI model that truly understands Chinese prompts and can render Chinese text inside images. This review covers everything you need to know.</p>

<h2>What Makes CogView-4 Different?</h2>

<p>Most AI image generators struggle with Chinese. You type a prompt in Chinese, and the result looks wrong. CogView-4 solves this problem.</p>

<p>Key advantages of CogView-4:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Native Chinese understanding</strong> — No translation needed. Chinese prompts work directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Chinese text rendering</strong> — It can write Chinese characters inside images correctly.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural context</strong> — It knows what "新年快乐" (Happy New Year) means and draws appropriate imagery.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast generation</strong> — Images appear in 5-10 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chinese Prompt Test</h2>

<p>We tested CogView-4 with this Chinese prompt:</p>

<blockquote>一位穿着汉服的年轻女子站在樱花树下，手持纸伞，柔和的阳光透过花瓣洒落</blockquote>

<p>The result was accurate. The woman wore traditional Hanfu. The cherry blossoms looked authentic. No translation artifacts. Compare this to DALL-E 3, which often misinterprets cultural clothing when given Chinese prompts.</p>

<h2>Chinese Text Rendering Test</h2>

<p>This is where CogView-4 truly shines. We asked it to create a poster with this prompt:</p>

<blockquote>电影海报，标题"永不言弃"，副标题"2026年度励志大片"，深蓝色背景，金色文字</blockquote>

<p>The result displayed both the title "永不言弃" and subtitle correctly. The characters were sharp and readable. This is nearly impossible with Midjourney or DALL-E 3, which scramble non-Latin text.</p>

<h2>CogView-4 vs DALL-E 3 vs Midjourney</h2>

<p>Here is how the three models compare:</p>

<p><strong>Nano Banana</strong> is a small AI model designed for speed. Some people call it a "lite" version of bigger models. But small size means trade-offs. This article compares Nano Banana with GLM-Image to help you choose.</p>

<h2>What is Nano Banana?</h2>

<p>Nano Banana is a lightweight AI model. It runs on phones and low-power devices. The name comes from its small file size and quick generation time.</p>

<p>Key facts about Nano Banana:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made for mobile devices</li>
  <li>Generates images in under 1 second</li>
  <li>Uses less memory than big models</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is GLM-Image?</h2>

<p><strong>GLM-Image</strong> uses the GLM model. It runs on powerful cloud servers. You use it through your browser—no install needed.</p>

<p>Key facts about GLM-Image:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Runs on H100 GPU clusters</li>
  <li>Creates 1024x1024 images</li>
  <li>Free tier with 3 daily generations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Speed vs Quality Trade-off</h2>

<p>Nano Banana is faster. But faster is not always better.</p>

<p>Here is what our tests showed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Nano Banana</strong>: Fast but blurry. Details like hair and fabric look flat.</li>
  <li><strong>GLM-Image</strong>: Takes 5-10 seconds but shows realistic textures.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you zoom in on a Nano Banana image, you see smudged edges. When you zoom in on a GLM-Image result, you see skin pores and fabric threads.</p>

<h2>3D Consistency Test</h2>

<p>We asked both models to draw "a red cube next to a blue sphere."</p>

<figure class="my-8">
  <img src="/blog/3d-shapes-demo.png" alt="Red cube and blue sphere with proper 3D shadows" class="rounded-xl w-full max-w-md mx-auto" />
  <figcaption class="text-center text-slate-500 text-sm mt-2">GLM-Image correctly renders 3D shapes with accurate shadows and reflections.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nano Banana made the shapes overlap weirdly. GLM-Image placed them correctly with proper shadows.</p>

<p>If you need objects in the right places, GLM-Image is the better choice.</p>

<p><strong>3D camera control</strong> lets you choose the viewing angle of AI-generated images. You can look at subjects from above, below, or any angle you want. This guide explains two ways to control the camera: sliders and natural language.</p>

<h2>What is 3D Camera Control?</h2>

<p>When AI creates an image, it picks a camera angle. Usually, you get a front view. But sometimes you want:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A view from above (bird's eye)</li>
  <li>A view from below (worm's eye)</li>
  <li>A side angle (profile)</li>
  <li>A tilted angle (Dutch angle)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3D camera control</strong> gives you this power.</p>

<figure class="my-8">
  <img src="/blog/camera-angles.png" alt="Six different camera angles for portrait photography" class="rounded-xl w-full" />
  <figcaption class="text-center text-slate-500 text-sm mt-2">Different camera angles create different moods and perspectives.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>The Slider Method (Qwen Style)</h2>

<p>Qwen models use number sliders. You set values like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Azimuth</strong>: 0 to 360 degrees (left-right rotation)</li>
  <li><strong>Elevation</strong>: -90 to 90 degrees (up-down tilt)</li>
</ul>

<p>This works but has problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must know what the numbers mean</li>
  <li>Small changes need many tries</li>
  <li>Most people find it confusing</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Natural Language Method (GLM Style)</h2>

<p>GLM-4 understands camera terms from movies and photography. Instead of numbers, you write words like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"low angle shot looking up at the hero"</li>
  <li>"aerial view of the city at sunset"</li>
  <li>"over-the-shoulder shot, shallow depth of field"</li>
  <li>"Dutch angle, 45-degree tilt"</li>
</ul>

<p>The AI knows what these mean. You get the angle you want without math.</p>

<h2>Example Prompts for Different Angles</h2>

<p>Try these prompts in our <a href="/create">generator</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Front view</strong>: "portrait photo, eye level, facing camera"</li>
  <li><strong>Side view</strong>: "profile shot, side angle, dramatic lighting"</li>
  <li><strong>Top-down</strong>: "bird's eye view, looking straight down"</li>
  <li><strong>Low angle</strong>: "worm's eye view, heroic pose, looking up"</li>
  <li><strong>Three-quarter</strong>: "45-degree angle, slightly above eye level"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which Method is Easier?</h2>

<p>For most people, natural language is easier. You describe what you see in your head. GLM-4 figures out the angles.</p>

<p>Try it now. Go to our <a href="/create">generator</a> and add camera terms to your prompt.</p>

<p>Creating the same character from <strong>multiple angles</strong> is hard for AI. The character often looks different in each image. This guide shows you how to make consistent character sheets using GLM-4.</p>

<h2>What is a Character Sheet?</h2>

<p>A character sheet shows the same person or creature from different views. Artists use them to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show front, side, and back views</li>
  <li>Keep designs consistent across projects</li>
  <li>Help 3D modelers build accurate models</li>
</ul>

<p>Game designers, animators, and comic artists all use character sheets.</p>

<figure class="my-8">
  <img src="/blog/character-sheet.png" alt="Female warrior character sheet with front, side, and back views" class="rounded-xl w-full" />
  <figcaption class="text-center text-slate-500 text-sm mt-2">A character sheet generated by GLM-4 showing front, side, and back views.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>The Challenge with AI</h2>

<p>Most AI models struggle with consistency. You ask for "the same woman from the front" and "the same woman from the side." But you get two different women.</p>

<p>This happens because AI generates each image separately. It does not remember what it made before.</p>

<h2>How to Get Consistent Results</h2>

<p>GLM-4 learns from millions of 3D models. It understands how objects look from different angles. Here is how to use it:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Add style keywords</strong></p>

<p>Include these words in every prompt:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"character sheet"</li>
  <li>"orthographic view"</li>
  <li>"white background"</li>
  <li>"multiple angles"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Describe details once</strong></p>

<p>Write all character details in the first prompt:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hair color and style</li>
  <li>Clothing and accessories</li>
  <li>Body type and pose</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3: Keep prompts similar</strong></p>

<p>Change only the angle between prompts. Keep everything else the same.</p>

<h2>Sample Prompts</h2>

<p>Here are prompts you can try in our <a href="/create">generator</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Full character sheet (one image):</strong></p>
<blockquote>"character sheet, orthographic view, white background, female warrior with red armor, front view, side view, back view, full body"</blockquote>

<p><strong>Front view only:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"female warrior with red armor, front view, standing pose, white background, full body, character reference"</blockquote>

<p><strong>Side profile:</strong></p>
<blockquote>"female warrior with red armor, side profile, standing pose, white background, full body, character reference"</blockquote>

<h2>Pro Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use "orthographic" to get flat, distortion-free views</li>
  <li>Add "same character" to reinforce consistency</li>
  <li>Generate at 1:1 aspect ratio for square sheets</li>
</ul>
